OMS to ServiceNow Runbook
=========================

            

This graphical runbook solution will take alerts from Microsoft Operations Management Suite, and Create an Incident for each alert within your Service-Now instance. Each of the alerts is stored in a database to simplify troubleshooting, and to provide allow
 the reconciliation of alert and incident data.


The runbook is a flexible alternative to the OMS alert functionality and is fully documented as a tutorial to illustrate automation of multiple processes with any ServiceNow table.


The runbook has been written using the Runbook Studio authoring application and leverages the integration and smart discovery capabilities provided for by the Integration Module for ServiceNow and SQL Server.  These Integration Modules are also available
 in the PowerShell Gallery.


Many of our users are learning about the Runbook Studio in conjunction with getting to grips with Azure Automation, with that in mind we have written this runbook which will take you through the process of creating a complete solution within your Azure subscription.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
